# GO-Android

## Description
This is a GPS running app that challenges you to run a certain amount of distance within a given time limit. Once that goal is reached, a new goal is set and they gradually get tougher. For location services, Google Maps API was used. 

## Setup
Download Android Studio and open this project through the editor. Connect your Android device via USB or configure an Android Simulator device. Then hit the Run button.

## Usage
Wait for the app to obtain your location. It will mark your starting location and trace your movements with a red line. A green label on the bottom will display the current distance to be convered within the time limit. 

Upon convering the indicated distance, a checkpoint flag will be placed at the current location and a new distance will be calculated. Over time, the distance to be covered will get more difficult as the time provided reduces.
