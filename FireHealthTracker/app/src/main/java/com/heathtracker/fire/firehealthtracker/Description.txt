The resulting phone app allows user to log their exercises (e.g., walks, runs) and display them on
Google maps. The app that you will build is a simple fitness app for Android. It allows you to
capture your runs and walks and view the stats on Google Maps. It uses sensors (viz. GPS,
accelerometers) in the phone to infer your activity (e.g., running) in an automatic manner. You can
start by building out the UI then add GPS, Google maps. You get first hand knowledge on implementing
a native app on the phone. You can use this as a foundation for creating and programming your own
ideas as part of the research project after summer. I will provide a high-level specification and
some pointers on design. But, you are free to design your app as you like or follow the guidelines
layout Iâ€™m providing.
